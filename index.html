		<h2> Digital 🧠</h2>
		 <p>
		 I am beginning to discover this exciting field and its secrets. But I would really like to work in this field. And to be honest, It was a real pleasure to learn how to create a profile and in general how to code.

 		<h2> 🏉 Rugby and Surf 🏄🏻‍♂ </h2>
 		<p>
 		Love the rugby since I'm born, France Rugby team 	will win the next World Cup for sure. For the surf, I'm just a beginner so I'm not trying to do some big 3.6 air and barrel, complicated for the moment.

 		<h2>Reading books 📚</h2>
 		<p>
 		It's important to read books, this opens up your mind. I'm reading Homo-Deus, a brief history of tommorow written by Yuval Noah Harari. Its the continuation of Homo Sapiens from the same author.
